         I started my tech journey in 2022, driven by a passion for solving problems through code. Since then, Iâ€™ve built several personal projects, collaborated on open-source work, and gained hands-on experience during my internship at [Company Name], where I worked on building responsive web apps. My background in [mention past job if relevant] taught me the value of teamwork and clear communication, which I now bring into every tech project I take on.goals
